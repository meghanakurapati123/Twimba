# Getting Started
Install the dependencies and run the project
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will launch your application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it. The application will automatically reload when you make changes. Any lint errors will appear in the terminal.

To create an optimized production build, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will compile your application into a build folder, ready for deployment.

To run tests in interactive watch mode:
```
npm test
```
If you need to customize the projectâ€™s configuration, you can eject it with:
```
npm run eject
```
Note: Ejecting is irreversible and gives you full control over the build configuration.

Version Control with Git
Initialize a Git repository in your project directory:
```
git init
```
Stage and commit your changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
To push your code to GitHub, first create a new repository on GitHub. Then add the remote origin:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```
Push your code:
```
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
Your project is now version-controlled and live on GitHub!
